# People and Parcel Share a Ride

K taxis (located at point 0) are scheduled to serve transport requests including N passenger requests 1, 2, . . . , N and M parcel requests 1, 2, . . ., M. Passenger request i (i = 1, . . ., N)) has pickup point i and drop-off point i + N + M, and parcel request i (i = 1, . . . , M) has pickup point i + N and drop-off point i + 2N + M. d(i,j) is the travel distance from point i to point j (i, j = 0, 1, . . ., 2N + 2M). Each passenger must be served by a direct trip without interruption (no stopping point between the pickup point and the drop-off point of the passenger in each route). Each taxi k has capacity Q[k] for serving parcel requests. The parcel request i (i = 1, 2, . . ., M) has quantity q[i].

Compute the routes for taxis satifying above contraints such that the length of the longest route among K taxis is minimal (in order to balance between lengths of taxis).

A route of a taxi k is represented by a sequence of points visited by that route: r[0], r[1], . . ., r[Lk] in which r[0] = r[Lk] = 0 (the depot)

## Input

- Line 1: contains N, M, and K (1 <= N,M <= 500, 1 <= K <= 100)
- Line 2: contains q[1], q[2],  . . ., q[M] (1 <= q[i] <= 100)
- Line 3: contains Q[1], Q[2], . . . , Q[K] (1 <= Q[i] <= 200)
- Line i + 3 (i = 0, 1, . . ., 2N + 2M): contains the ith row of the distance matrix

## Output

- Line 1: contains an integer K
- Line 2k  (k = 1, 2, . . ., K): contains a positive integer Lk
- Line 2k + 1 (k = 1, 2, . . ., K): contains a sequence of Lk integers  r[0], r[1], . . ., r[Lk]
